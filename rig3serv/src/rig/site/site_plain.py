    Describes how to generate the content of a site using the "plain" theme.

    The "plain" theme inherits from the "default" theme and simply redefines
    some of the HTML templates. The behavior is the same as the default theme
    so the implementation is mostly empty, except for the part that find
    template files: if a file is not found in the plain template, one from the
    default template will be used.

        doesn't exist either, that's a problem with the calling site generator
