Rig3 Documentation: Installation

Pre-amble: Rig3 is not a server. It's a standalone application that parses text
files to generate a blog. Given a configuration file that describes the source
to process and the kind of site to generate. It then generates the corresponding
HTML files.

The purpose of this document is to explain how to get and install Rig3.


Summary of install steps for the impatient:
* SVN checkout (cf below)
* Pass test suite (mandatory)
* Create a configuration file (cf /misc/Configuration.txt)
* Run rig3 to generate content


----------------------
0- Supported Platforms
----------------------

The only requirement is a working Python installation.
Python 2.4 or 2.5 are known to work under both Linux and Cygwin.


----------------------
1- Grab the source and run the test suite
----------------------

The project lives at https://github.com/ralfoide/rig3

As of right now, the best way to grab the source is by using an anonymous
git checkout:
 $ git clone https://github.com/ralfoide/rig3.git

This will create a directory "rig3/rig3serv" with all the code.

Make sure the two main files are executable:
 $ chmod +x rig3serv/src/rig3.py
 $ chmod +x rig3serv/src/test_rig3.py

The first thing you might want to do is check the unit tests pass:
 $ python2 rig3serv/src/test_rig3.py

You should see something like this:
 UT Main ['rig3serv/src/test_rig3.py']
 Rig Tests: rig_test_case [...bunch of stuff here...]
 .
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ran 99 tests in 0.491s
 OK

If you don't see "OK" at the end, contact me ;-)

OK seriously, you *really* those tests to pass.
The thing is that when I'm in a development cycle, I may purposedly
make the unit tests fail while I'm working on something which isn't
completly finished. At home I use a simple shell script that will
periodically checkout a version of Rig3 in a temp folder and run the
unit tests. If the unit test succeed, my main version of Rig3 is updated
and run. This script is provided in /misc/update_rig3.sh; it is to be
considered experimental and needs to be customized if you want to use it.


----------------------
2- Create a configuration file
----------------------

To run Rig3 you need to provide a configuration file.
Please read /misc/Configuration.txt for more details.

Also look at /testdata/album, a simple album used by the unit test suite
(do not modify it or the tests might fail!). It should give you an idea of
the content structure expected.


Once you have your configuration file, run Rig3 like this:

 $ rig3serv/src/rig3.py
or
 $ rig3serv/src/rig3.py -c my_sites.rc


To get some command-line help, try this:

 $ rig3serv/src/rig3.py --help

Remember that Rig3 is not a "server" nor a daemon. It's a one-shot run.
I simply run the script periodically in a cron job.
 

I'm sure I could expand this document. Feel free to let me know what you
would like to see here.
